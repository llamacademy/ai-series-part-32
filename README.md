# Navmesh AI Tutorial 32 - NavMeshAgent Avoidance in Depth - 5 Key Takeaways for Optimal Avoidance

Learn how NavMeshAgent obstacle avoidance works... in DEPTH! In this deep dive into NavMeshAgent avoidance you'll learn 5 key takeaways for improving NavMeshAgent avoidance using the Unity Navigation System - no external assets needed! 

The demo scene has 3 scenarios to run:
1. 1 on 1 scenario - preview agent avoidance in a controlled environment
1. Circle Scenario - Spawns 100 (configurable) agents in a circle and sends them all to the opposite point on the circle, creating a traffic jam in the middle
1. Narrow Pathways Scenario - Spawns 4 groups of 25 agents (configurable) and sends them to the opposite corner through a narrow pathway creating a traffic jam

Scenario 2 and 3 are recreated from the examples on the [RVO website](https://gamma.cs.unc.edu/RVO/)
